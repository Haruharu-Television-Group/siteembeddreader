# siteembeddreader
A JavaScript package that allows you to easily embed a read-aloud button on your website.  
Once the tag is added, it will read the content inside the body!

## How it works
```
<script src="siteembeddreader.min.js"></script>
```
 and  
 ```
<div class="rb-1"></div>
```
Simply place them anywhere you like.  
*Note: Any block element can be used instead of the `div`.
